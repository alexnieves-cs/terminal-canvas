 * inspectorSignature, `summary` on its own three numbers, and (since M9a)
 * `review` on reviewSignature(review). Canvas re-renders on every mousemove
 * over the canvas (setCursor) and on every frame of a drag (setPanelRect);
 * without all three halves this pane would rebuild at 60Hz for rect changes
 * it displays nothing about, the same trap SideRail documents. `review` is
 * the sharper case of the three: buildReviewFields returns a FRESH object on
 * six of its eight arms, so an unfrozen prop here is not a hypothetical
 * regression — it is the DEFAULT outcome of wiring the query the obvious way,
 * and the failure is silent: nothing throws, nothing looks wrong in a
 * screenshot, the app just gets heavy while a panel is dragged.
 *
 * The toggle stays mounted when the inspector is collapsed, for the same
 * reason the rail's does: it is the only way back without ⇧⌘\.
