# Streams run: cross-lane requests

Append a request when you need a file another lane owns. One entry each; the
owning lane answers by landing it or saying why not, and edits the status.

Format:

```
### Q-001 · <what you need>
- From: <lane> · To: <lane>
- File: <path>
- Smallest change: <one or two sentences>
- Status: open
```

### Q-001 · `tc tonight` as a short form of `tc plan tonight`
- From: C · To: D
- File: src/cli/** (the `tc` argument parser)
- Smallest change: map `tc tonight [stop]` to the existing `tc plan tonight [stop]` line (M480's verb, already bound by `buildPlan` and refused to a teammate caller in plan.ts). No new channel; the agent door already works through `tc plan`.
- Status: open
