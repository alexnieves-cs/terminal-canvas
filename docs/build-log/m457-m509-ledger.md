# M457–M509 ledger — the streams run, 6.0 to a finished product

Run book: [docs/streams/RUN.md](../streams/RUN.md).
Plan: [docs/streams/ROADMAP.md](../streams/ROADMAP.md).
Ownership: [docs/streams/ownership.json](../streams/ownership.json).
**This ledger is the state.** One row per merged PR, newest at the bottom of its stream.

## Decisions

- 2026-10-21: the owner chose all five streams at once, and to ship 6.0.0 unsigned
  (signing and notarization are decided before 6.1).
- Goldens are written only after the owner has looked at the CI shot gallery.
